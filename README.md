# [JSL05] Submission: Galaxy Playlist Generator

## Project Overview
In this project, I combined my knowledge of JavaScript arrays and the `map()` function to create a personalized "Awesome Mix" playlist for each of the Guardians of the Galaxy. My task was to filter and organize songs based on each Guardian's musical preference, displaying a playlist tailored just for them.

## Elements Included
- Code that includes the necessary modifications to meet the project requirements.
- GitHub repository that contains the updated code files.

## Reflections
### Areas of Mastery
Throughout this project, there were many new things I learned, but there are no areas of mastery regarding the `map()` function as an array method. 

### Challenges Faced
- Debugging issues: Many challenges stemmed from debugging.
- Syntax for `map()`: Struggled with finding the proper syntax for a `map()` function, leading to setbacks.
- Displaying the playlist: Difficulty in coding a solution that fits for displaying the playlist.

### Areas of Improvement
1. **Descriptive variable names:** Start using more meaningful variable names to enhance code readability.
2. **Error handling:** Handle errors properly by logging them to aid in debugging.

### Overall Learning Experience
Learning about JavaScript arrays and the `map()` function was valuable. I plan to explore other built-in array methods like `reduce()`, `every()`, and `some()`, as well as advanced features. Practicing and coding more will facilitate further learning and growth as a developer.
